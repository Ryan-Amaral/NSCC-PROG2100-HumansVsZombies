A project for an Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This is a text/console based predator prey simulator themed with humans and zombies. This program goes through cycles where sometimes the zombies dominate, and sometimes the humans do. Humans just simply move, and are programmed to move away from the nearest zombie. After a certain amount of turns, a human will 'recruit' new humans. Each zombie will convert a single adjacent human if it has the chance to. Zombies will starve to death after a few turns. The program does a good job at staying alive, meaning that it is a well balanced simulation.
